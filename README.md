### Quantum Mechanics?

##### The ability of particles part of the atomic scale to behave as neither particles nor waves, they exhibit a unique nature which is understood and studied as Quantum Mechanics. 

#### Double Slit Expermient
##### Let's take a look at Double Slit Experiment, now we know for sure that a Double Slit experiment for a particle-system would give us no interference pattern. Rather it would simply give us two patterns directly in front of the slits. Now performing the same experiment with a wave-system we get an interference pattern. Light on the other hand was believed to be of particle nature, but with this experiment it gave an interference pattern.

##### In modern physics, the double-slit experiment is a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles; moreover, it displays the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical phenomena.
