## INTRODUCTION

### Quantum Mechanics?

##### The ability of particles part of the atomic scale to behave as neither particles nor waves, they exhibit a unique nature which is understood and studied as Quantum Mechanics. 

<a name="double-slit-experiment"></a>
#### Double Slit Expermient
##### Let's take a look at Double Slit Experiment, now we know for sure that a Double Slit experiment for a particle-system would give us no interference pattern. Rather it would simply give us two patterns directly in front of the slits. Now performing the same experiment with a wave-system we get an interference pattern. Light on the other hand was believed to be of particle nature, but with this experiment it gave an interference pattern.

##### In modern physics, the double-slit experiment is a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles; moreover, it displays the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical phenomena.

#### Quantization
##### An essential ingredient in quantum mechanics, it is the idea that certain objects or properties could tune in by only a certain defined set. It is the process of constraining an input from a continuous or otherwise large set of values (such as the real numbers) to a discrete set (such as the integers).

#### Light as Particles
##### The study of Photoelectric effect by scientists such as Max Planc found that certain types of metal and other materials will eject electrons when light shines on them. They expected that the number of electrons ejected from the metal would increase with the intensity of light directed towards the metal. What they found instead, was that the wavelength of the light affected the number of electrons ejected. The reason was not understood till much later, when Einstein theorized that electromagnetic energy comes in packets, or quanta which we now call photons. So light behaves as a wave and as a particle, depending on the circumstances and the effect being observed. This concept is now known as wave-particle duality.

<a name="matter-as-waves"></a>
#### Matter as waves
##### Matter does exist as waves, just that we cannot see it, as its amplitude of vibration is much smaller than the body's total size. A fairly intriguing conecpt where-in the wavelenght of body or matter in motion can be given by, λ=h/p.
##### Here h = 6.626×10−34Js and p is the moment of the moving body. As we can see from the value of h, it is far too small ≈ 10−34 scale, so it can't give any significant wavelenght for large objects.
